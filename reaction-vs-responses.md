# [Reactions vs Responses - Hugh Lashbrooke](https://hughlashbrooke.com/2022/04/06/reactions-vs-responses/)

In a recent forum discussion about early mistakes people made in their community management careers, I responded with a lesson I learned some years ago that highlights the dichotomy between **reactions** and **responses**:

> Something I learned early on in my journey is that if a conversation in your community is getting heated, it’s always a good idea to take a beat and respond when you have had more time to think about what to say. It’s super easy to jump into replies quickly in order to calm folks down, but that seldom works and frequently leads to further upset.

Don’t just react – think about how you will respond in a measured and considered manner.

_If community work is your thing, come and join the conversations in [the Rosieland forum](https://village.rosie.land/) – the asynchronous format encourages considered responses over immediate reactions._
