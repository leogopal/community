# [Workshop Resources Defining a Community Membership Identity - Hugh Lashbrooke](https://hughlashbrooke.com/2020/04/29/workshop-resources-defining-a-community-membership-identity/)

Yesterday I presented a workshop as part of [the first CMX Global Connect event](https://events.cmxhub.com/events/details/cmx-cmx-global-presents-cmx-global-connect/) about defining a membership identity for your community. I really enjoyed myself and I loved all the interaction from everyone watching!

As promised during my session, [here’s a link to the worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bt7_7hmMJO1cQdXET73OiTbwrRAyp5cJb5xQfnILyQc/edit) that we worked through together ([and here’s a blank one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GBfpOccy3z3PBTfkzFkxRDhxpVdl-uzWh7BHc9uU4b4/edit) so you can go through the exercise yourself), and you can check out the slides here:

The book I recommended during the session is called [The Art of Community by Charles Vogl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28762683-the-art-of-community).

This workshop was a lot of fun and I’m looking forward to engaging with more folks around this topic – feel free to [chat with me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hlashbrooke/) if you want to talk through any of it. I’ll post some further thoughts on this topic in a separate post, including my answers for the WordPress community that I included in the slides.
